# Punctuation

We tend to avoid punctuation in UI microcopy if it doesn't hurt the meaning and helps scan the information. See the basic rules to follow.

## Periods
Avoid using periods on solitary sentences within these UI elements:

* Labels
* Hover text
* Bulleted lists
* Dialog body text
* Input field hints

Use periods on:

* Multiple sentences
* Any sentence followed by a link (links themselves should not be full sentences)

#### Periods in longer text
Longer or complex sentences can use periods if doing so better suits the context. For example, if the rest of your app’s flow doesn’t use periods, introducing them in a few places may appear inconsistent.

### Colons
Skip colons after labels.
* Do: **Add to**
* Don't: **Add to:**
