# Alerts and Error Messages

## Writing Tips
The message text should clearly explain the following:

* What happened. (For example: What completed and what did not; what rule was violated and where; what stopped or what started.)
* Why this happened.
* What specific steps or actions the user needs to take to correct the problem.

Example: 
> Failed to execute the pkg_info command: problem description here. To resolve the issue, do this and that.

Avoid "please" except in situations where the user is asked to do something inconvenient or the software is to blame for the situation.

Avoid uppercase text and exclamation points.

Avoid phrasing that will seem silly to the user, such as “unexpected error.”
