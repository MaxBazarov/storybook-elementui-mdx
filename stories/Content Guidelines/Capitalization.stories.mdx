# Capitalization
The styles of capitalization used for interface text are book title capitalization and sentence-style capitalization.

## Book Title Capitalization 
All words in titles and headers must be capitalized except for prepositions and conjunctions. But if the preposition or conjunction consists of more than 4 letters, it must be capitalized. For example, “with” - must be lower-cased, while “Through” must be capitalized.

Use book title capitalization for the following elements: 

- Page and screen titles, 
- section titles,
- tile titles, 
- field labels, 
- menu items, 
- tabs, 
- wizard steps titles, 
- statuses,
- button labels,
- column headings, 
- links for performing operations in the GUI.

**Note**: If you have a hyperlink that follows some explanatory or introductory text in the GUI, treat such links as usual sentences: capitalize the first word and put a period at the end (and period should not be included into the link). 

Examples: 
> This is an interesting new feature, and so on and so forth. <a>Learn more</a>.<br />
> This is an interesting new app, and so on and so forth. <a>Buy now</a>.


## Sentence-Style Capitalization 
Capitalize only the first letter of the initial word and other words normally capitalized in sentences, such as proper nouns. 

Use sentence-style capitalization for the following elements:
- Checkboxes, 
- radio buttons,
- drop-down menu items, 
- text boxes inline placeholder,
- interface messages and tooltips,
- descriptions (of screen, section, field),
- status bar text. 

## All Uppercase (for Wireframes Only)
In wireframes use all uppercase for: 
- Column headings,
- tile titles,
- statuses in tiles,
- button labels.
