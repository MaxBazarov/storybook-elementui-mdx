# Naming

## General Convention
When developing new screens with UI elements that contain texts like menu or list headers, descriptions of options, etc, follow the below principles:

- If a description in the UI is a word-combination, do not use a dot at the end. For example, “List of servers” - no dot. If a description is a sentence having a grammatical subject and/or a predicate, a dot must be used at the end. For example, “You can specify the start parameters that apply when you start the service from here.” - a dot is used. “Select the computer’s response if this service fails.” - a dot is used.
- Do not use “please” in text messages. When prompting a user to do something, use imperative mood.
- In sentences containing placeholders, position the placeholder after its definition.
- Also follow [Capitalization](/?path=/docs/content-guidelines-capitalization--page) guidelines.

These rules are valid for all Odin Control Panels, including CCPv2, CCPv1, PCP and RCP

## Buttons and Links Labels
Label interface buttons and separate links (not included into the text) in accordance with tasks the users will need to accomplish. Present all labels in active voice and imperative mood (infinitive forms of verbs).

Capitalize captions for buttons and links in book title style. Use no ending punctuation.

Example:
> Add Reseller

For submit buttons in forms try to avoid generic labels, such as «OK», «Submit» etc.  
Use brief but meaningful text that explains what happens after the users clicks this button.  

Do not use "(s)" or "(es)" after nouns to indicate singular or plural. Use the plural if there is a possibility of more than one. For example, Add Selected Plans, not ~~Add Selected Plan(s)~~.

Examples:

## Links in the Text
If you have a hyperlink that follows some explanatory or introductory text in the GUI, treat such links as usual sentences: capitalize the first word and put a period at the end (and period should not be included into the link).
 
Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text.

Valid: Read the [automation guide](..) for details.  
Invalid: Read [the automation guide](..) for details.

Don’t create links with titles “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.

Valid: Read the [automation guide](..) for details.  
Invalid: For details [click here](..)!.

If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.

Valid: Read the [automation guide](..).  
Invalid: Read [the automation guide.](..)
