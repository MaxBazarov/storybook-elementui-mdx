# Notifications

## Introduction
Notification content includes 3 main parts: 
1. Message — a title of the notification. 
2. Details — text (up to 250 symbols) displayed on short form of notification. It should contain all useful information, including time expectations, reason of the problem and next step recommendations if there are any.
3. Full Details — text (more than 250 symbols are allowed) shown on full form of notification. It's ok to have the same text on short and long forms. They should be distinguished only and only if there is some additional information that is not essential at the moment customer receives the notification. 

Clicking on the notification leads to a linked screen. In addition to this link there may be an optional call-to-action — action following to related object or scenario.
