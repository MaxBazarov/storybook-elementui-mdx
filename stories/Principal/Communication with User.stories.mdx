# Communication with User
The design of interactive products requires effective communication with users. Each product (via its interface design) needs to “tell” users what value it proposes, how to use it, and why the user should care.

## Principle 1: Don't make user guess — explain
Remember of unskilled users, and provide some explanations and helpful tips to them — so they don't think that the interface is too hard to operate with.   
Ensure that labels, including links, clearly reflect the information and items contained within.

**Example**   
<!-- <span style="color:red">:fa-times-circle-o:</span> -->
In this case it is not possible to predict, what kind of name is required: is it a domain name, or the name of certificate authority?   
What text format is acceptable? User will define all these things, eventually. But we don't need our users to suffer.

<!-- <span style="color:green">:fa-check-circle-o:</span> -->
It's better to add a hint as an example of data format, and a helpful field description, explaining, what kind of data needed and what is it for.

## Principle 2: To motivate users do something, tell them what value they will get.
User will be ready to apply some extra efforts — and spend more money and time (e.g. filling in different forms) — only if the user will see a real, meaningful value in it. Each time you want your user to do something, tell him about the value he will get.   
Especially if you want him to buy something — upgrade the subscription, renew or replace it.

**Example**  
<!-- <span style="color:red">:fa-times-circle-o:</span> -->
This message is only stating a fact — one certificate will stop being actual.   
You can replace it by the other. It's all true, but there is no incentive for a user to do this right now.   
And if he will not do it now, he maybe will buy a new certificate later — and somewhere else.

<!-- <span style="color:green">:fa-check-circle-o:</span> -->
This text reminds the user of the certificates real value and utility.   
Now there is a good reason for him to buy a new certificate right.

## Principle 3: Clearly explain the consequences of irreversible actions, leading to data loss.
Explain the consequences of actions, what will happen and when. User need to be aware of all consequences of his actions. Make [confirmation modal dialogs](/ui-kit/layouts/modal-dialog/confirmation) meaningful and helpful.

But also don't overdo it: not each action requires detailed explanation. Reversible actions, not causing data loss or charging a client, doesn't require confirmation.

** Example 1**  
<!-- <span style="color:red">:fa-times-circle-o:</span> -->
Don't hide information about possible data lost, even if you think it's obvious. In case when no explanation is given, a user could never be sure he fully understands the consequences of the action.  
<!-- ![](3.1-Bad.png?sizes=635px) -->

<!-- <span style="color:green">:fa-check-circle-o:</span> -->
If some data will be lost as a result of user's actions, clearly communicate this fact to the user.   
<!-- ![](3.1-Good.png?sizes=634px) -->

** Example 2**  
<!-- <span style="color:red">:fa-times-circle-o:</span> -->
Don't scare users with obscure messages, that doesn't provide any helpful information somewhere in the documentation.  
<!-- ![](3.2-Bad.png?sizes=631px) -->

<!-- <span style="color:green">:fa-check-circle-o:</span> -->
Give enough details so the user could be sure he understands the situation and can make an informed decision by himself, without reaching the Support service.  
<!-- ![](3.2-Good.png?sizes=633px) -->

## Principle 4: Clearly communicate the next step
Show the user the clear idea of what to read and to do next.   
Setting up this understanding alleviate user's uncertainty about what's going on and what will happen next.  
It also reduces user's frustration and makes new user's onboarding easier.  

**Example 1:**  
<!-- <span style="color:red">:fa-times-circle-o:</span> -->
It's not a good idea to tell that some action is required without providing a short way to execute this action right here and now.  
<!-- ![](4.1-Bad.png?sizes=1015px) -->

<!-- <span style="color:green">:fa-check-circle-o:</span> -->
Add call-to-action or link to the next step to simplify the user's path.  
<!-- ![](4.1-Good.png?sizes=1017px) -->


**Example 2:**  
<!-- <span style="color:red">:fa-times-circle-o:</span> -->
It's common to meet messages that don't provide any actionable and useful information. They look poor.   
<!-- ![](4.2-Bad.png?sizes=362px) -->

<!-- <span style="color:green">:fa-check-circle-o:</span> -->
If it is possible, it's better to add more useful details and hints about what will happen next; among other things, it will simplify onboarding for new users.
