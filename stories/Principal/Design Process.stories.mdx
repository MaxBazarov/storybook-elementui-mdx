# Design Process

## Principle 1: Consistency First
Apply the same solution to the same problem.

If you have to choose between new solution that you think is better — and old, but already implemented and familiar to the users — always select the last one.

Our users expect the interface and system behavior to be consistent and familiar. When a new application offers familiar patterns and controls, user learns to deal with it faster and easier.  

Make sure, that these items are consistent throughout the system and your project:
* Screen layout
* Location of the elements
* Design Patterns
* Controls
* Language use
* Navigation
* Visual language
