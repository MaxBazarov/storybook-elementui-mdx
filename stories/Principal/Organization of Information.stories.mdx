# Organization of information
Information should be presented in a structure that reflects user’s needs and the value service provides. A clear, logical structure of the screen will save users from frustration. And users will be happy to have an efficient way to locate needed information and achieve their goals easily.

Organizing information includes putting the most critical and important information on the top of the screen, grouping the related elements and ensuring that the minimum of necessary information is available.

## Principle 1: It should be easy for user to get information he wants to get — and impossible to miss a critical one.
Important functions, that are needed for user right here and right now, should be easy accessible.  Don't make user click down to the second or third level trying to find them.   
The critical things, that require user's immediate attention and some actions, should attract user's attention by their position and visual appearance.  User should no have any chance to miss them.   

**Example 1:**  
-Don't use a secondary menu to organize the service information. This type of structure hides the information. To observe the general information and to see if there any problems related to this service, a user would need to click on each menu item, and check each section separately.  

-Use Dashboard instead of adding secondary menu. Group the information and place it in several tiles, showing the most important information right on these tiles. Hide advanced settings and more detailed information on the next level, accessible by clicking on "Actions" button on the relevant tile.  
Your users will be able to review all important things at a glance and decide if they want to go deeper or not.  


**Example 2:**  
-Customer Control Panel (Version 1) shows on the Home screen always the same Users section. It doesn't matter, if there are some problems with any of users — this section stays the same. To see if all is ok there, our user needs to go deeper, on the Users page and review his users' statuses.  

-Users home tile in CCPv2 behave differently. If any problem occurs, it will be instantly shown on the home tile, and it is well notable if there any problems right after logging into the Control Panel. The user can be always sure that he'll never miss something important.  

**Example 3:**  
-Warning and problem messages might be missed by a user if they are placed somewhere else but the top. 
-Show [warning and problem messages](/app-kit/common/notifications/type-problem) on the very top of the screen or modal dialog.  

## Principle 2: Current state of the object/screen should be easily understood.
User needs to be sure that everything is under control, and that he clearly understands what's happening now, is it right or wrong, why is it hapening, and what can be done about it.   
To help your users with this, keep them informed about the things that matter to them. Consider not only indicating the state but adding some more details and explanations (if it's appropriate). Also, make sure that there is no any ambiguities or misguiding information regarding the indication of the current state.

**Example 1:**  
-You can come across this example in CCPv1. The status of password expiration contradicts itself: icon says it's on; label says the opposite.  

-Visual representation of the status should not raise questions and leave the customer in uncertainty.   

**Example 2:**  
-This is the case when the subscription was purchased, but wasn't provisioned yet. That's the reason why there is no information of when this subscription was created and when it expires. But the user shouldn't know this details, and he shouldn't guess what's wrong with this subscription. Now, when there is no any explanation, the user is wondering, if everything is ok, and if it's not, what he could do with it.   


-Fix the problem by adding the message, explaining, what's going on now and what the user can do about it(basically, just wait). That's enough to remove total uncertainty and the feeling that something goes wrong.

## Principle 3: If user has to make a decision, make sure he is provided with all necessary information.
Users should not have to remember data or to look for important details all over the screen.   
Make sure that the necessary information is displayed on the right place, and that it really helps a user to make a decision.   
But don't overcomplicate things. Show only a sufficient minimum of data.  

**Example 1:**  
-Here is a poor message, that doesn't provide helpful information (when it will expire, what will happen next) and doesn't sound friendly. It seems more like a push, not an advice.   


-Warning and problem messages should provide the right amount of information: enough to understand the problem, it's severity and how to fix it.   


**Example 2:**  
-This is a piece of the interface of the CCPv1. This is the second step of the Purchase wizard, where the user decides, what service plan to buy. But the information about actual prices will be shown only on the next step. The user can't easily compare prices for different plans and make an informed decision.   

-CCPv2 provides an opportunity to compare prices for different plans and periods on the same step. Easy and helpful.  


## Principle 4: Advanced features for experienced users should not impair the experience of unskilled users.
Identify proficiency profiles of your target audience (personas), and make sure that the service dashboard is understandable and easy for use for the most unskilled personas. Simplify the interface whenever possible without decreasing user’s productivity. It is acceptable to place the advanced functionality in 1-2 clicks from the service dashboard.

**Example 1:**  
-Don't overcomplicate the tile with a big amount of links, details, and functions available right on the tile. It's too complicated and hard understandable for an average user.  

-Use [Actions button](/ui-kit/controls/button/actions) to gather together all functions available.
