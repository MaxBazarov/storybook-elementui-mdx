# Principal
This is a set of important principles, that will guide you through the APS package design process. These principles should serve you as the guidance through the design process, ensuring that the interfaces of all applications will be user-friendly and consistent.

1. [Design Process](design-process)
 - Consistency First. But not for the sake of the very consistency.
2. [Communication with User](communication)
 - Don't make user guess — explain.
 - To motivate users do something, tell them what value they will get.
 - Clearly explain the consequences of irreversible actions, leading to data loss.
 - Clearly communicate the next step.
3. [Organization of Information](information)
 - It should be easy for user to get information he wants to get — and impossible to miss a critical one.
 - Current state of the object/screen should be easily understood.
 - If user has to make a decision, make sure he is provided with all necessary information.
 - Advanced features for experienced users should not badly affect the experience of unskilled users.
